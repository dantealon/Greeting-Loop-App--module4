# Greeting Loop App

A simple JavaScript-based app that loops through an array of names and prints personalized greetings in the browser's console. This project is part of the "HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for Web Developers" course on Coursera.

## Description

This app demonstrates the use of JavaScript arrays, loops, and conditionals to print greetings to the console. It checks whether the name starts with the letter "J" (case-insensitive) and outputs a personalized greeting accordingly:
- If the name starts with "J" or "j", it prints "Goodbye [Name]".
- For all other names, it prints "Hello [Name]".

## Features

- Loops through an array of names.
- Checks the first letter of each name.
- Outputs either a "Hello" or "Goodbye" message to the console based on the condition.
- Built with basic JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Basic styling (if applicable).
- **JavaScript**: Logic for looping and greeting messages.
