Greeting Loop App
This is a simple web app built for the Coursera "HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers" course.

Overview
The app loops through an array of names and prints a greeting for each name. If the name starts with "J" or "j", the greeting will be "Goodbye [Name]". For all other names, it prints "Hello [Name]". This project is designed to practice JavaScript functions, loops, and basic conditionals.

How It Works
The script.js file contains an array of names.
The app loops through the array, checking the first letter of each name.
It prints either "Hello [Name]" or "Goodbye [Name]" based on the condition.
Getting Started
Clone or download this repository.
